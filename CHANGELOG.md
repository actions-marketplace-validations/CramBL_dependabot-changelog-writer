## [1.3.0]

### Added

- The new `duplicate-entry-strategy` lets users configure the behaviour when an unreleased section already contains an entry where the same dependency is updated, see the [README](./README.md) for more on that.

### Fixed

- Fix some potential workflow security issues, this is part of an effort of fixing issues identified through static analysis of GitHub Actions workflow files.
- Fix erroneous changelog entry in 'overwrite' mode if multiple identical entries were present in the unreleased section AND they were listed with semantic versions in code blocks.

## [1.2.0]

### Changed

- `dependabot-changelog-writer` now creates signed commits using the author and email from the input `push-token` when run in CI
- The name of updated dependencies is now sanitized for backticks (\`) enabling more customization for changelog patterns. **NOTE:** The default pattern produces the same changelog entries as they always did, but if you rely on a custom changelog pattern, you will have to change '[dep]' to '\`[dep]\`' to maintain the same pattern
- Make `libgit2` obsolete, cutting binary size in half
- Optimize more, cut binary size in half again

## [1.1.4]

### Fixed

- When `push-changes` was set to false, the would-be changelog diff was printed but the changelog was not actually changed, it is now.

## [1.1.3]

### Fixed

- Fix invalid 'jq' command when action revision is specified as a git SHA

## [1.1.2]

### Changed

- Improved various error messages
- Disallow prefixing the `section-header` input with `###` as it is already implied and leads to unexpected behaviour

## [1.1.1]

### Fixed

- Ensure inputs passed as arguments to the binary are not interpreted by bash before hand, fixes [#75](https://github.com/CramBL/dependabot-changelog-writer/issues/75)

## [1.1.0]

### Changed

- Make it possible to use a git SHA to pin the action (the given SHA has to have an associated tag)

### Fixed

- Avoid accessing github context directly in the script of a workflow step

### Dependencies

- `log`: 0.4.26 → 0.4.27 ([#65](https://github.com/CramBL/dependabot-changelog-writer/pull/65))
- `env_logger`: 0.11.7 → 0.11.8 ([#66](https://github.com/CramBL/dependabot-changelog-writer/pull/66))

## [1.0.3]

### Changed

- No longer statically link OpenSSL on the linux build. Instead we rely on the OpenSSL lib on the GitHub runner, ensuring continuous upgrade of OpenSSL and vastly reducing binary size.

## [1.0.2]

### Fixed

- [#51](https://github.com/CramBL/dependabot-changelog-writer/issues/51) issue where a previous h3 section with similar dependencies caused invalid position calculations.

### Changed

- If pushing changes fails, try again with force pushing. Resolves issue where dependabot force-pushes mid-workflow.

## [1.0.1]

### Changed

- When `push-changes` was set to false, the would-be changelog diff was printed but the changelog was not actually changed, it is now.
